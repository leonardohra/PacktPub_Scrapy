Learning Java Functional Programming;Application Development;43.99;296;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-java-functional-programming%0A;Functional programming is an increasingly popular technology that allows you to simplify many tasks that are often cumbersome and awkward using an object-oriented approach. It is important to understand this approach and know how and when to apply it. Functional programming requires a different mindset, but once mastered it can be very rewarding. This book simplifies the learning process as a problem is described followed by its implementation using an object-oriented approach and then a solution is provided using appropriate functional programming techniques. Writing succinct and maintainable code is facilitated by many functional programming techniques including lambda expressions and streams. In this book, you will see numerous examples of how these techniques can be applied starting with an introduction to lambda expressions. Next, you will see how they can replace older approaches and be combined to achieve surprisingly elegant solutions to problems. This is followed by the investigation of related concepts such as the Optional class and monads, which offer an additional approach to handle problems. Design patterns have been instrumental in solving common problems. You will learn how these are enhanced with functional techniques. To transition from an object-oriented approach to a functional one, it is useful to have IDE support. IDE tools to refactor, debug, and test functional programs are demonstrated through the chapters. The end of the book brings together many of these functional programming techniques to create a more comprehensive application. You will find this book a very useful resource to learn and apply functional programming techniques in Java.

Finally, we build a solid and elegant typographic scale, and make sure your messages and communications display correctly with responsive emails.
Python Game Programming By Example;Game Development;31.99;230;https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/python-game-programming-example%0A;With a growing interest in learning to program, game development is an appealing topic for getting started with coding. From geometry to basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms, there are plenty of concepts that can be applied in almost every game. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale. It is the third most popular language whose grammatical syntax is not predominantly based on C. Python is also very easy to code and is also highly flexible, which is exactly what is required for game development. The user-friendliness of this language allows beginners to code games without too much effort or training. Python also works with very little code and in most cases uses the “use cases” approach, reserving lengthy explicit coding for outliers and exceptions, making game development an achievable feat. Python Game Programming by Example enables readers to develop cool and popular games in Python without having in-depth programming knowledge of Python. The book includes seven hands-on projects developed with several well-known Python packages, as well as a comprehensive explanation about the theory and design of each game. It will teach readers about the techniques of game design and coding of some popular games like Pong and tower defense. Thereafter, it will allow readers to add levels of complexities to make the games more fun and realistic using 3D. At the end of the book, you will have added several GUI libraries like Chimpunk2D, cocos2d, and Tkinter in your tool belt, as well as a handful of recipes and algorithms for developing games with Python.
Learning Raspberry Pi;Hardware & Creative;35.99;258;https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/learning-raspberry-pi%0A;Raspberry Pi is one of the most popular development boards and a staple tool among developers because of its low cost and flexibility. Learning Raspberry Pi is a practical tutorial, providing you with the skills required to design and build your own projects. By working through the examples and projects in the book, you will build up your knowledge of software and hardware development and be able to create projects of your own. This book contains a set of tutorials and examples for commonly used technologies, accompanied by practical projects that bring the topics together. Each individual project that you become involved with allows you to develop an important set of skills, building up your confidence to tackle more advanced applications of your own.

OpenCV for Secret Agents;Application Development;26.99;302;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/opencv-secret-agents%0A;OpenCV is a grand collection of image processing functions and computer vision algorithms. It is open source, it supports many programming languages and platforms, and it is fast enough for many real-time applications. What a lot of gadgets we can build with such a handy library! Taking inspiration from the world of James Bond, this book adds a spark of adventure and computer vision to your daily routine. Protect your home and car with intelligent camera systems that analyze people, cats, and obstacles. Let your search engine praise or criticize the images that it finds. Hear a voice from your phone that responds to your body language. Attune yourself to another person's rhythm by glancing at a display that magnifies a heartbeat or a breath. Learn OpenCV and see your world as never before.
Android NDK: Beginner's Guide - Second Edition;Application Development;39.99;494;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/android-ndk-beginners-guide-second-edition%0A;Android NDK is all about injecting high-performance and portable code into your mobile apps by exploiting the maximum speed of the device they run on. This book will show you how to create C/C++-enabled mobile applications and integrate them with Java. The books starts with teaching you how to access native API and port libraries used in some of the most successful Android applications. Next, you will move on to create a real native application project through the complete implementation of a native API and porting existing third-party libraries. Moving forward, you will learn how to access the keyboard and input peripherals and read accelerometer or orientation sensors. Finally, you will dive into more advanced topics such as RenderScript.
